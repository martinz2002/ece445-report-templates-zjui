\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Problem statement}
This is a sample document of this template, and here comes citation. You can cite \cite{book1,paper1} and \cite{book2}. However, putting citation at the end of a sentence is also acceptable \cite{webpage1}.
\section{Importance}
\begin{equation}
    f\left( x \right) =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{n!}f^{\left( n \right)}\left( x_0 \right) \left( x-x_0 \right) ^n}, x\in U\left( x_0 \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    e^{ix}&=1+ix+\frac{1}{2!}\left( ix \right) ^2+\frac{1}{3!}\left( ix \right) ^3+\cdots \frac{1}{n!}\left( ix \right) ^n+\cdots
    \\
    &=1+ix-\frac{1}{2!}x^2-i\frac{1}{3!}x^3+\frac{1}{4!}x^4+i\frac{1}{5!}x^5-\cdots
    \\
    &=\left( 1-\frac{1}{2!}x^2+\frac{1}{4!}x^4-\cdots \right) +i\left( x-\frac{1}{3!}x^3+\frac{1}{5!}x^5-\cdots \right)
    \\
    &=\cos x+i\sin x
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\section{Literature Review}
This is a sample listing.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
#include<stdio.h>
void fuzzy(int x){
    return x;
}
int main(){
    int a = 0, b, c;
    scanf("%d", &b);
    c = b;
    if (a == b)
        a = fuzzy(c);
    else
        b = fuzzy(a);
    printf("%d %d\n", a, fuzzy(c));
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Methodology}

Test the ability\footnote{This is an example footnote.} to print some units, say (in texts), \SI{10e5}{\um\ohm\degree}.

It also applies to equations,
\begin{equation}
    R_{t}=\SI{10e5}{\um\ohm\degree}
\end{equation}
