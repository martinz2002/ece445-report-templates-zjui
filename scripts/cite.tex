\chapter{Citation}
This template uses IEEE citation style, as is required by the final report and the individual progress report. To begin with, generate your own \verb|.bib| file. Below is a sample of this:

\lstinputlisting{references.bib}

You may use zotero and its BetterBibLaTeX plugin to generate this bibliography file. To learn more about IEEE style and biblatex, go to \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX} and \url{https://guides.library.illinois.edu/ENG198/citationstyle}.

In the body of your report, type command \verb|\cite{<keys>}| to cite a source. Here is an example:

  ``Follow the guidelines listed in the textbook \cite[pp. 129-130]{streetman2015}, and calculate the result.

  Note that conventional method of measuring Hall voltage requires reversal directions of the magnetic field and sample current, which aims to eliminate the error introduced by an unknown additional potential \cite{li2023}. Tentatively we are going to find out how it is generated and its impact to our measurement.''
