\chapter{Design}
Discuss general design alternatives. Give equations, simulations, general circuits. Describe design in detail, addressing each major component. Include schematics with components, drawings, flowcharts, etc. Some teams may wish to split this chapter in two: 2. Design Procedure, and 3. Design Details. This template will not automatically update numbering systems for chapters, sections, figures, tables, etc., so keep track of them as you develop and revise the text.

\section{Component or Block}
To create a section head, use \verb|\section{}|. It automatically formats as above and creates a table of contents entry (after you compile).

\subsection{Subcomponent or subblock}
To create a subsection head, use \verb|\subsection{}|. It automatically formats as above and creates a table of contents entry.

Following is a “template” for displayed math. It looks much better than the Word template.

\begin{align}
    EQO &= \sum_{i=1}^n W_j * r_{ij} \\
    EHI &= L_1 \times ESI + L_2 \times EQI \\
    \frac{EE}{EHI} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 PCG + \beta_2 RGP + \cdots + \beta_i X_i + \\
    & \cdots + \beta_9 ICWUR + \beta_{10} ECPG + \beta_11 WCPG + \epsilon_i
\end{align}
